As it's difficult or very time consuming to take attendance of students on papers also sometimes students mark the fake proxy of their friends :grin: So to remove this I came with a solution: Class Attendee !!

**Class Attendee** - An automated attendance marking tool that uses **facial recognition** to take attendance of the whole class to easen work and save time for the professor. This is solely built during the period of **Microsoft Engage Mentorship program'22** conducted by Microsoft to provide mentorship and to enrich freshmen with various software development techniques.

#### Problem statement (as given)
To build a fully functional prototype to demonstrate the application of Face Recognition Technology

Feature | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Export Attendance as Excel | User/Professor can easily fetch attendance in form of excel.
Security Features | The web-application would provide more security and better user interface and user experience to the product.
Class Management | All class management activities (branch/section wise) separately for every year students, creating assignment in the application itself assigning tasks and keep a record of every student activites individually in different sections.
